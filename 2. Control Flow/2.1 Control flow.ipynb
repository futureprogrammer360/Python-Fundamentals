    "In many situations in life, we humans make decisions. For instance, if it is snowing, then it would be best to stay inside. If it is sunny, then we should go outdoors. In programming, this is known as **conditionals**. Conditionals are used when a program needs to evaluate a condition and change its behavior (or flow) accordingly."

    "Consider the real life situation of planning a day's activities. More likely than not, the decision-making process would be something along these lines: **\"If it is sunny, I will go outside, or if it is raining, I will go outside with an umbrella, or else, I'll just stay inside...\"** Note in this statement, there are three important phrases: **if**, **or if**, and **or else**. **If** describes the first possible condition, **or if** describes the second (or third, fourth, etc) possible condition, and **or else** catches all other possible conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python programming, the same principle applies. The only minor difference is the wording. In Python, **if** is also `if`, **or if** is `elif` (short for \"else if\"), and **or else** is just `else`. Together, these three make up conditionals in Python. Below is a sample program using conditionals. Try to make sense of the code on your own and continue when you are ready."
