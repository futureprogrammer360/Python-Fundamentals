It is better of course, to make sure the program has a way to end, but if you ever run into an infinite loop unexpectedly, don't panic, just simply interrupt the program's execution and all will be well. In IDLE and most other runtime environments, just press `CTRL-C` and a `KeyboardInterrupt` will happen, ending the program."
